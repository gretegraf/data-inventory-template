# Data Inventory Template

This repository contains a **blank data inventory template** designed to help digital preservation teams document and assess their organizational data sources.  

The template is flexible and iterative, so you can start with core fields and expand as needed. It is also a work in progress, so fields and structure may be updated over time based on team needs and feedback.

The goal is to increase trust, reduce risk, and make knowledge about data sources visible and actionable.

## Why a Data Inventory?

Organizations often interact with more data sources than they realize, including:  
- Systems and dashboards  
- Documentation and training resources  
- Collaborative notes and ticketing threads  
- Program or workflow statistics  

Without documentation, these sources may be forgotten, duplicated, or become inaccessible. A data inventory helps:  
- Support onboarding of new staff  
- Identify gaps and opportunities for better use of data  
- Reduce risk of “invisible” or lost data  
- Build trust and encourage collaboration

## Instructions

**Purpose:**  
This is a blank template for documenting and assessing organizational data sources.  

**Frequency:**  
Complete the inventory every 1–2 years, or whenever new data sources are added.  

**Starting a New Inventory:**  
- Make a new copy of the `Data_Inventory_Template` tab (or duplicate the entire workbook if preferred).  
- Rename the worksheet to reflect the date or project (e.g., `UNIT_Data_Source_Inventory_2025-10-01`).  

**Filling It Out:**  
- Complete the inventory fields for each data source.  
- Refer to the **Field Explanations** tab (second tab) for definitions and guidance.  

**Adding New Fields:**  
- If you need to track information not covered by the existing columns, you can add new fields to the worksheet.  
- Clearly label the new columns and add definitions in the **Field Explanations** tab for future reference.  
- Keep new fields consistent across copies of the inventory if multiple worksheets are maintained.  

**Appendices:**  
- Add any appendices (e.g., potential future data to collect, excluded sources) as additional worksheet tabs.
